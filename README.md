# Data-harmonization-Project-Chen-Lab

The primary aim of this project is to develop and validate cutting-edge NLP algorithms, meticulously tailored to harmonize variable nomenclature within the extensive GERAS datasets (Wimo et al. 2013). Moreover, we aimed to develop a visualization tool to show variable alignment results, thereby fostering an enhanced and enriched user experience by using the NLP alignment tool. In pursuit of this objective, our project will delve into the realm of NLP, harnessing its power to seamlessly reconcile and standardize variable labels within the GERAS datasets, as documented by Wimo et al.(2013).  This project is part of a larger effort to develop such tools for better data harmonization and thus would need further efforts to see it to fruition.
